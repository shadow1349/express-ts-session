   * Please note that `secure: true` is a **recommended option**.
   * However, it requires an https-enabled website, i.e., HTTPS is necessary for secure cookies.
   * If `secure` is set, and you access your site over HTTP, **the cookie will not be set**.
   *
   * The cookie.secure option can also be set to the special value `auto` to have this setting automatically match the determined security of the connection.
   * Be careful when using this setting if the site is available both as HTTP and HTTPS, as once the cookie is set on HTTPS, it will no longer be visible over HTTP.
   * This is useful when the Express "trust proxy" setting is properly setup to simplify development vs production configuration.
